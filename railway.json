## Also check your repo structure

Go to `github.com/thegreatshamil/earthworm` and tell me — is `main.py` in the **root** of the repo or inside a subfolder? 

Because if your structure is like:
```
earthworm/
  app/
    main.py        ← inside app folder
  requirements.txt
```

Then the start command needs to be:
```
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
